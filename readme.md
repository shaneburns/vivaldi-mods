# Modding Vivaldi

This is a personal project that I decided to share.  I hope you
enjoy it, and more so I hope it inspires you to create your own
customizations.  If you do, please share them with the community!

If you're curious how to start modding Vivaldi, check out
the [Vivaldi forums](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications)
and [this awesome post](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi)
for more information. 

In short, to enable modifications in Vivaldi:
- visit the *[vivaldi://experiments](vivaldi://experiments)* and enabling "Allow for using CSS modifications"
- set the directory for your styles in Settings > Appearance > Custom UI Modifications
- create a css file of your own or try some of the styles I've made (more details in files)
- restart Vivaldi

Also, this link will allow you to open DevTools for the browser UI:
