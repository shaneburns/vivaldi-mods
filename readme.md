# ▒▓  Spacious UI Mod  ▓▒

## Open | Minimal | Clean

This is a personal project that I decided to share.  I wanted to 
be able to see the window background image more often, and voila.  I 
hope you enjoy it, and more so I hope it inspires you to create your 
own customizations.  If you do, please share them with the community!

## Installation

In short, to enable modifications in Vivaldi and install these styles:
- clone this repo
- visit the *[vivaldi://experiments](vivaldi://experiments)* and enable "Allow CSS modifications"
- open Settings and navigate to the newly added Appearance > Custom UI Modifications field and point to the cloned repo
- restart Vivaldi

## Modding Vivaldi

If you're curious how to start modding Vivaldi, check out
the [Vivaldi forums](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications)
and [this awesome post](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi)
for more information. 

Also, [this link](vivaldi://inspect/#apps) will allow you to open DevTools for the browser UI:

### A bit more detail
		
This design was created while using Vivaldi on Windows with the [Gradient theme](https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/V6kJNYnzvWX);
though all default themes and multiple custom themes have also been tested.

The initial design only accounted for the following settings:
- Address Bar Position: Top
- Tab Bar Position: Left
- Bookmark Bar Position: Bottom
- Status Bar: Showing
- Panels Position: Left

### Updates

- expanded the styles to account for (I think) all ui layouts.
- tested on Windows and Linux
- added styles to the window controls (minimize,maximize,close) for Windows and Linux (set colors)
- converted styles to SASS for maintenance enjoyment

## Reporting Issues

If you find any issues with ui layouts or themes, and feel so inclined, please feel free 
to create an issue on the GitHub repo.
Screenshots are highly encouraged!

I also made a [codepen](https://codepen.io/mcShane/pen/vYboNEW) that shows off some themes just cause.
